# GreatSCT

GreatSCT is a tool designed to generate metasploit payloads that bypass common anti-virus solutions and application whitelisting solutions.

GreatSCT is current under support by @ConsciousHacker

## Software Requirements:

### Linux

1.  Debian or Kali - run the setup script - sudo ./setup.sh -c

## Setup (tl;dr)

> NOTE: Installation must be done with superuser privileges. If you are not using Kali Linux, prepend each command with `sudo` or change to the root user before beginning.

Run `./setup.sh -c` on Linux.

Install by cloning from git, not via apt!

### Quick Install

```bash
apt-get -y install git
git clone https://github.com/ConsciousHacker/GreatSCT.git
cd GreatSCT/
cd setup
sudo ./setup.sh -c
```

### Regenerating Config

> NOTE: This must be done with superuser privileges. If you are not using Kali Linux, prepend each command with `sudo` or change to the root user before beginning.

Most of the time the config file at `/etc/veil/settings.py` will not need to be rebuilt but in some cases you might be prompted to do so. The file is generated by `config/update.py`.

It is important that you are in the config/ directory before executing update.py. If you are not, settings.py will be incorrect and when you launch Veil you will see the following.

```bash
    Main Menu

            0 payloads loaded
```

Don't panic. Enter the config/ dir and re-run update.py.
